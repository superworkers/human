        <p>
          Fiduciary responsibility requires complete audit trails. SEC/FINRA compliance demands consistent, explainable
          recommendations. Most AI tools create liability exposure because advisors cannot prove their AI
          recommendations followed required processes.

        <h3>The challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Utah is investing over $1B in Great Salt Lake conservation by 2034, but no integrated system exists to verify
          whether these investments deliver water to the lake. The RFP requires verifiable reductions from measurable
          telemetry, yet that infrastructure does not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water districts face an impossible choice: keep SCADA systems air-gapped and secure, or connect them and
          accept new attack vectors.

      <h3>Why this matters for investors</h3>
      <p>
        Critical infrastructure requires zero-trust collaboration and court-admissible verification. The same
        architecture that protects water districts protects financial services firms from compliance exposure.
