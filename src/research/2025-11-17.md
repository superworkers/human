# Why Deterministic Orchestration Matters

Protocols like MCP, AgentKit, and ADK are solving how models connect to tools. They do not solve who governs those connections. That is the gap Human AI is built to close.

## The Governance Gap

In regulated environments, the questions are not just "can the model do this?" but:

- Should this user be allowed to make this request?
- Does the operation comply with policy and regulation?
- What audit trail documents the decision?

## Our Position

Human AI is the deterministic control plane above every model call. We enforce policy before invocation, validate execution during the task, and record immutable proof after completion.

## Why Now

Enterprises are moving toward multi-model stacks and open protocols. The only sustainable path forward is neutral orchestration with explicit human authority.
