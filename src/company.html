    <h1>9606 = Human</h1>
    <h2>What does the name 9606.ai mean?</h2>
    <p>
      That's a question worth unpacking – so much meaning in one number. When we sat down to build this company, we kept
      returning to a fundamental question: who should AI serve? In a world racing to automate humans out of the
      equation, we believed the answer was obvious but revolutionary: AI should amplify human potential, not replace it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's when we found 9606 – the taxonomic number for Homo sapiens in the human genome classification. 🤓 Nerd
      alert! 🚨 It's the scientific identifier for what makes us human. We chose it as our name because it represents
      our mission:
    </p>
    <h2>HUMAN first</h2>
    <p>
      We don't build AI that replaces people. We build AI that makes people more capable, more productive, more
      valuable. Every feature, every algorithm, every design decision starts with: "Does this make the human more
      powerful?"
    </p>
    <h2>HUMAN centered</h2>
    <p>
      We don't force workers to adapt to AI's limitations. We architect AI to adapt to how humans actually work – their
      workflows, their language, their judgment. The AI serves you, not the other way around.
    </p>
    <h2>HUMAN outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      We don't measure success by how much we automate. We measure success by how much more you can accomplish, how much
      faster you grow, how much more money you make. Your success is our success.
    </p>
    <p>
      9606.ai isn't just a company – it's a movement built by people who believe that the future of work isn't humans OR
      machines, it's humans AMPLIFIED by machines. We call them Superworkers – people who do the work of 3-5 employees
      because they have AI infrastructure that eliminates the boring stuff and amplifies their judgment, creativity, and
      expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're a company that equips workers and teams with the AI they need to do their best work, earn more money, and
      get promoted faster. We're building the infrastructure that turns knowledge workers into Superworkers – people who
      deliver outcomes that were previously impossible alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Field-proven by the teams using it every day, we are working to continually deliver AI that makes you better at
      your job, not obsolete. Because the goal isn't to replace humans. The goal is to unleash them.
